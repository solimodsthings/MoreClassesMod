# Overview
This is a mod for [Himeko Sutori](https://himekosutori.com/) that adds new unlockable character classes and class abilities to the base game. It is built using the gameâ€™s new mutator loader and does not make modifications to base content files. 

The mod is designed to work with existing save files. Create a backup of your save file if you choose to use this mod in the middle of an existing campaign.
